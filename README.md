# Air-bnb-dashboard-using-Power-BI
Created an interactive dashboard using Airbnb data set. Took a background color or Airbnb logo and transparency set at 0.
Here we have created two filters and few cards to show the KPI. Next have created vertical bar charts which shows "total last reviews by year" and "total reviews by months". Also created horizontal bar charts to show "average price by neighborhood" and "top 10 hosts by total reviews".
The donut charts represents "Total neighborhoods by group" and lastly tables which shows "avg price by neighborhood group and room type" and "avg reviews by month by neighborhood group and room types".
